This is a research project on the operational status of a retail store within the first 3 months from its opening date.
The project will be conducted by obtaining raw data from the store, and then the data will be processed using two methods.
The first method involves using Python to process and transform the raw data into an analyzable format.
The second method utilizes SQL, specifically MySQL, to query and transform the data into a suitable format for analysis.
The transformed data will be analyzed using Power BI to address the business problem.
Finally, a report will be written based on the analyzed data.
